While the software is generally considered safe and is widely used by network administrators for legitimate purposes, users should always ensure they download it from trusted sources to avoid potential risks. Some antivirus programs may flag advanced_port_scanner.exe as a potential threat due to its behavior resembling that of network scanning tools often used by malicious actors, leading to false positives.
